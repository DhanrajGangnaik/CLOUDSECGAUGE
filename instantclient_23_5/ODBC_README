Oracle Instant Client ODBC
--------------------------

Oracle Instant Client ODBC for Windows systems complies with ODBC 3.52
specifications. It is based on the features of Oracle client, without the need
for a traditional ORACLE_HOME installation.

Pre-requisite:
-------------
Instant Client ODBC depends on the Oracle Instant Client Basic or Basic Light
package from OTN. For details on installing the Oracle Instant Client Basic or
Basic Light packages, refer to the Oracle Call Interface Programmer's Guide.

Installing Instant Client ODBC
------------------------------
1. Install the Instant Client Basic or Basic Light.
   Download Instant Client Basic or Basic Light package from OTN and unzip it
   into the designated directory (e.g. C:\oracle\product). Once the package is
   unzipped, a new directory with name instantclient_XX_Y (where XX refers the
   major version and Y refers the minor version of Instant Client) is created
   under the designated directory (e.g C:\oracle\product\instantclient_XX_Y).
   Under this new directory, all the libraries and files related to Instant
   Client are stored.

   Note: 
   The Instant Client Basic Light doesn't support non-ASCII characterset. So
   the Japanese version of Oracle ODBC driver can be installed only with
   Instant Client Basic package.
   

2. Now unzip the downloaded Instant Client ODBC from the same designated
   directory where the basic or basic light was unzipped.

   Instant Client ODBC package has the following files/shared libraries under
   the Instant Client directory (instantclient_XX_Y):
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   |      File name           |        Description                            |
   |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   |                          |                                               |
   | sqora32.dll              | Oracle ODBC driver DLL                        |
   |                          |                                               |
   | sqoras32.dll             | Oracle ODBC driver setup DLL                  |
   |                          |                                               |
   | sqresus.dll              | Oracle ODBC driver resource DLL               |
   |                          |                                               |
   | ODBC_README              | (this file)                                   |
   |                          |                                               |
   | odbc_install.exe         | Oracle Instant Client ODBC driver installer   |
   |                          |                                               |
   | odbc_uninstall.exe       | Oracle Instant Client ODBC driver uninstaller |
   |                          |                                               |
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Execute odbc_install.exe to install the Oracle ODBC driver from the Instant
   Client directory.

   Usage: odbc_install.exe [JA]
   - The odbc_install.exe installs the English version of Oracle ODBC driver by
     default. When it is started with  optional argument JA, then it will
     install the Japanese version of Oracle ODBC driver.

     For e.g.:
       C:\oracle\product\instantclient_XX_Y> odbc_install.exe - installs the
       English version of Oracle ODBC driver.

       C:\oracle\product\instantclient_XX_Y> odbc_install.exe JA - will install
       the Japanese version of Oracle ODBC driver.

   - It should be started with Administrator privilege in order to install the
     Oracle ODBC driver successfully.
   - The installer will include the Instant Client directory name as part of
     the driver name while registering the Oracle ODBC driver in ODBC Driver
     Manager on Windows.
     For e.g.: Driver name will be "Oracle in instantclient_XX_Y" if it is
     installed from C:\oracle\product\instantclient_XX_Y.
   - It is mandatory to have the Instant Client Basic or Basic Light binaries
     in the current (Instant Client) directory, to install the Oracle ODBC
     driver successfully.

Uninstalling Instant Client ODBC
--------------------------------
1. Execute odbc_uninstall.exe to uninstall the Oracle ODBC driver which is
   installed from Oracle Instant Client home. This will uninstall the Oracle
   ODBC driver from Windows ODBC Driver manager.

2. Delete all files and sub directories under Instant Client directory to remove
   the Instant Client ODBC completely.
